# Battleship_RL
Deep Reinforcement learning on classic board game Battleship
Based on another Github project https://github.com/thomashirtz/gym-battleship

Battleship game consists of two player: an attacker and a defender
The defender sets up ships on the map, and the attacker bombs the ships in the map.

Two deep RL algorithms are used for the attacker agent:
Deep-Q network and Actor-critic method

Deep-Q network are also applied to defender agent.
